\title{Write plots from a list into a directory or PDF document}
\usage{
write_plots(
  plots,
  folder_name,
  plot_filetype,
  width,
  height,
  units = "in",
  dpi = 300,
  combined_pdf = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{plots}{List of plots to write to disk.}

\item{folder_name}{Name of folder to create on disk (if it does not exist) to write each plot from list. 
If using \code{combined_pdf} argument, then it will be the name of the PDF document.}

\item{plot_filetype}{Image type to write. One of "png", "eps", "ps", "tex", "pdf", "jpeg", "tiff", "bmp", or "svg".
Image type will be overwritten if using \code{combined_pdf} is used.}

\item{width}{Numeric plot width in \code{units}. If not supplied, uses the size of current graphics device.}

\item{height}{Numeric plot height in \code{units}. If not supplied, uses the size of current graphics device.}

\item{units}{Character string plot height and width units, one of "in", "cm", or "mm". Default \code{"in"}.}

\item{dpi}{Numeric resolution of plots. Default \code{300}.}

\item{combined_pdf}{Logical value indicating whether to combine list of plots into one pdf document. Default \code{FALSE}.}

\description{
Write a list of plots (ggplots; as used by fasstr ) into a directory or PDF document. 
   When writing into a named directory each plot will be named by the plot name listed in the list; uses ggplot2::ggsave function.
   When writing into a PDF document (\code{combined_pdf == TRUE}) the plot names will not appear; uses grDevices:pdf function.

# Working examples:

# Example plots to save
plots <- plot_annual_lowflows(station_number = "08NM116")

# Write the plots as "png" files
write_plots(plots = plots, 
            folder_name = "Low Flow Plots",
            plot_filetype = "png")

# Write the plots as a combined "pdf" document

            folder_name = "Low Flow Plots",
            combined_pdf = TRUE)
